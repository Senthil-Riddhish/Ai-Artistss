## A Brief of the Prototype:
- Our prototype's real-time object detection and distance recognition features are meant to make self-driving cars safer and more efficient. By leveraging the power of Intel technologies and frameworks, we've created a robust system that combines advanced computer vision algorithms and deep learning models.Intel AI Analytics Toolkit, featuring optimised deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, powers the prototype. Intel-optimized libraries like oneDNN and oneDAL were used to train and infer deep learning models. This helps us locate items around the car.
