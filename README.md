## A Brief of the Prototype:
- Our prototype's real-time object detection and distance recognition features are meant to make self-driving cars safer and more efficient. By leveraging the power of Intel technologies and frameworks, we've created a robust system that combines advanced computer vision algorithms and deep learning models.Intel AI Analytics Toolkit, featuring optimised deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, powers the prototype. Intel-optimized libraries like oneDNN and oneDAL were used to train and infer deep learning models. This helps us locate items around the car.
- We also use Intel OpenVINO Toolkit for deep learning inference to analyse observed items in real time. The autonomous car can make rapid, precise decisions, improving its responsiveness and safety.The prototype also makes use of computer vision libraries such as OpenCV for comprehensive image and video processing duties, allowing us to effectively deal with a variety of environmental conditions.
- By integrating these technologies into our prototype, we have developed a system that can detect and classify objects in real-time, estimate distances to the lead vehicle, identify road hazards, and make informed decisions to ensure the safety of the autonomous vehicle and its occupants.
